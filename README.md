# CalorieCAM
This innovative app simplifies calorie and nutrient tracking by utilizing artificial intelligence.  Instead of manually inputting food details, users simply take a photo of their meal. The AI then analyzes the image, providing a detailed breakdown of the food's nutritional content, including calorie count and nutrient information.
